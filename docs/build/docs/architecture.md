# Architecture Overview

This guide explains how MikroORM works internally. It's intended for users who want a deeper understanding of the ORM's behavior, as well as contributors looking to understand the codebase.

## Core Patterns[​](#core-patterns "Direct link to Core Patterns")

MikroORM implements several well-known patterns from Martin Fowler's *Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture*:

* **[Data Mapper](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/dataMapper.html)**: Entities are plain objects with no knowledge of the database. The ORM handles all persistence logic.
* **[Unit of Work](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/unitOfWork.html)**: Tracks all changes made to entities during a request and persists them in a single transaction.
* **[Identity Map](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/identityMap.html)**: Ensures that each database row is represented by exactly one entity instance within a request context.

## Key Components[​](#key-components "Direct link to Key Components")

| Component           | Responsibility                                                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **EntityManager**   | Main facade for all ORM operations. Provides `find`, `persist`, `remove`, `flush` methods. |
| **UnitOfWork**      | Tracks entity changes, computes change sets, orders queries, manages transactions.         |
| **IdentityMap**     | Caches entity instances by primary key. Ensures one instance per database row.             |
| **MetadataStorage** | Holds entity definitions (properties, relations, indexes) discovered at startup.           |
| **Hydrator**        | Converts database rows into entity instances.                                              |
| **Driver**          | Abstracts database-specific operations (SQL vs MongoDB).                                   |
| **QueryBuilder**    | Builds and executes queries programmatically (SQL drivers only).                           |

## Statefulness and Request Context[​](#statefulness-and-request-context "Direct link to Statefulness and Request Context")

MikroORM is **stateful** by design. The EntityManager maintains an IdentityMap that accumulates entities throughout its lifetime. This is intentional - it enables change tracking and ensures entity identity.

However, this means **you must not share a single EntityManager across multiple requests**. Doing so would:

* Cause memory to grow unbounded
* Lead to stale data
* Create race conditions in concurrent requests

The solution is to **fork the EntityManager** for each request:

```
// In middleware or request handler
const em = orm.em.fork();
```

For convenience, MikroORM provides the `RequestContext` helper that uses Node.js `AsyncLocalStorage` to automatically provide request-scoped EntityManager instances:

```
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  RequestContext.create(orm.em, next);
});

// Later in your code - automatically uses the forked EM
const users = await orm.em.find(User, {});
```

See [Identity Map and Request Context](https://mikro-orm.io/docs/identity-map.md) for full details.

## Entity Lifecycle[​](#entity-lifecycle "Direct link to Entity Lifecycle")

Entities exist in one of several states relative to the EntityManager:

| State        | Description                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **New**      | Entity created via `em.create()` or constructor. Will be inserted on next `flush()`.                                                                                                    |
| **Managed**  | Entity is tracked by the UnitOfWork. Changes will be detected and persisted on `flush()`. Entities become managed after being loaded from the database or after `flush()` inserts them. |
| **Detached** | Entity is not tracked by any UnitOfWork. Either explicitly via `em.clear()`, or because it belongs to a different EntityManager fork. Use `em.merge()` to re-attach.                    |
| **Removed**  | Entity scheduled for deletion via `em.remove()`. Will be deleted on next `flush()`.                                                                                                     |

## Query to Entity: Hydration[​](#query-to-entity-hydration "Direct link to Query to Entity: Hydration")

When you query the database, MikroORM transforms raw rows into entity instances through a process called **hydration**:

<!-- -->

Key points about hydration:

1. **IdentityMap check first**: Before creating a new instance, the ORM checks if an entity with that primary key already exists in the IdentityMap.
2. **Single instance guarantee**: You always get the same object reference for the same database row within one request context.
3. **Relation references**: Related entities are initially loaded as **references** (objects with only the primary key). They become fully loaded when populated.
4. **State snapshot**: The hydrated state is stored internally for later change detection.

## Entity to Database: Change Tracking and Flush[​](#entity-to-database-change-tracking-and-flush "Direct link to Entity to Database: Change Tracking and Flush")

MikroORM uses a **snapshot-based** change tracking approach. When an entity is hydrated or persisted, the ORM stores a copy of its state. On flush, it compares the current state against this snapshot:

<!-- -->

The flush operation:

1. **Computes change sets**: Compares current entity state against stored snapshots.
2. **Orders queries**: Uses topological sort to respect foreign key constraints.
3. **Batches operations**: Groups INSERTs, UPDATEs, and DELETEs for efficiency.
4. **Wraps in transaction**: All changes are committed atomically.
5. **Updates snapshots**: After successful commit, snapshots are updated to reflect the new state.

See [Unit of Work](https://mikro-orm.io/docs/unit-of-work.md) for flush modes and transaction details.

## Populating Relations[​](#populating-relations "Direct link to Populating Relations")

Relations are not loaded automatically. By default, a relation property contains only a **reference** - an object with the primary key but no other data:

```
const book = await em.findOne(Book, 1);
console.log(book.author);       // Reference: { id: 5 }
console.log(book.author.name);  // undefined - not loaded!
```

To load related entities, use the `populate` option:

```
const book = await em.findOne(Book, 1, { populate: ['author'] });
console.log(book.author.name);  // 'John Doe' - loaded!
```

### Loading Strategies[​](#loading-strategies "Direct link to Loading Strategies")

MikroORM supports three loading strategies:

| Strategy                 | Description                                         | Best For                                        |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **`select-in`**          | Separate query per relation level using `IN` clause | To-many relations, avoiding cartesian explosion |
| **`joined`**             | Single query with JOINs                             | To-one relations, when you need filtering       |
| **`balanced`** (default) | Uses `joined` for to-one, `select-in` for to-many   | General purpose, best of both worlds            |

```
// Using specific strategy
const books = await em.find(Book, {}, {
  populate: ['author', 'tags'],
  strategy: LoadStrategy.JOINED,
});
```

See [Loading Strategies](https://mikro-orm.io/docs/loading-strategies.md) for detailed comparison.

## QueryBuilder: Raw vs Hydrated Results[​](#querybuilder-raw-vs-hydrated-results "Direct link to QueryBuilder: Raw vs Hydrated Results")

The QueryBuilder (SQL drivers only) provides two ways to get results:

### `qb.execute()` - Raw Data[​](#qbexecute---raw-data "Direct link to qbexecute---raw-data")

Returns plain JavaScript objects directly from the driver. Does **not** use the IdentityMap or hydration:

```
const rows = await em.createQueryBuilder(User)
  .select(['id', 'name'])
  .where({ active: true })
  .execute();

// rows = [{ id: 1, name: 'John' }, { id: 2, name: 'Jane' }]
// These are plain objects, not entity instances
```

### `qb.getResult()` - Hydrated Entities[​](#qbgetresult---hydrated-entities "Direct link to qbgetresult---hydrated-entities")

Returns fully hydrated entity instances, registered in the IdentityMap:

```
const users = await em.createQueryBuilder(User)
  .select('*')
  .where({ active: true })
  .getResult();

// users = [User { id: 1, name: 'John' }, User { id: 2, name: 'Jane' }]
// These are managed entities, changes will be tracked
```

Use `execute()` for read-only queries where you don't need change tracking. Use `getResult()` when you need to work with entities.

See [QueryBuilder](https://mikro-orm.io/docs/query-builder.md) for full documentation.

## Serialization[​](#serialization "Direct link to Serialization")

MikroORM provides two approaches to converting entities to plain objects:

### Implicit Serialization[​](#implicit-serialization "Direct link to Implicit Serialization")

When you call `toJSON()` or `toObject()` on an entity, serialization is driven by the `populate` hints used when loading:

```
const user = await em.findOne(User, 1, {
  populate: ['books'],
  fields: ['name', 'books.title'],
});

const dto = wrap(user).toObject();
// Only includes: id, name, books[].id, books[].title
```

Key behaviors:

* Only populated relations are serialized as objects
* Unpopulated relations serialize as foreign key values
* The `fields` option controls which properties appear in output

### Explicit Serialization[​](#explicit-serialization "Direct link to Explicit Serialization")

For full control, use the `serialize()` helper:

```
import { serialize } from '@mikro-orm/core';

const dto = serialize(user, {
  populate: ['books', 'profile'],
  exclude: ['password'],
  forceObject: true,
});
```

This ignores the original populate hints and lets you specify exactly what to include.

See [Serializing](https://mikro-orm.io/docs/serializing.md) for all options including serialization groups.

## Driver Architecture[​](#driver-architecture "Direct link to Driver Architecture")

MikroORM uses a driver abstraction to support multiple databases. The `@mikro-orm/core` package contains database-agnostic logic (EntityManager, UnitOfWork, IdentityMap), while driver packages provide database-specific implementations.

**SQL drivers**: `@mikro-orm/postgresql`, `@mikro-orm/mysql`, `@mikro-orm/mariadb`, `@mikro-orm/sqlite`, `@mikro-orm/libsql`, `@mikro-orm/mssql` - all with full QueryBuilder support.

**MongoDB driver**: `@mikro-orm/mongodb` - uses the native MongoDB driver. No QueryBuilder (use `em.find()` with filter objects instead).

| Feature                       | SQL Drivers         | MongoDB Driver                     |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| QueryBuilder                  | Full support        | Not available                      |
| Transactions                  | ACID transactions   | MongoDB transactions (4.0+)        |
| Relations                     | Foreign keys, JOINs | References, no JOINs               |
| Migrations                    | Schema diffing      | Not needed (schemaless)            |
| M<!-- -->:N<!-- --> Relations | Pivot tables        | Array of references on owning side |

Most MikroORM features work identically across drivers. The main difference is that MongoDB lacks JOIN support, so filtering by related entity properties is not supported - you need to query from the owning side or denormalize your data.

## Event System[​](#event-system "Direct link to Event System")

MikroORM fires events at key points in the entity lifecycle. Available events:

* **Entity**: `onInit`, `onLoad`, `beforeCreate`, `afterCreate`, `beforeUpdate`, `afterUpdate`, `beforeDelete`, `afterDelete`, `beforeUpsert`, `afterUpsert`
* **Flush**: `beforeFlush`, `onFlush`, `afterFlush`
* **Transaction**: `beforeTransactionStart`, `afterTransactionStart`, `beforeTransactionCommit`, `afterTransactionCommit`, `beforeTransactionRollback`, `afterTransactionRollback`

Events can be handled via **lifecycle hooks** (decorators on entity methods) or **event subscribers** (separate classes).

```
@Entity()
class User {
  @BeforeCreate()
  setCreatedAt() {
    this.createdAt = new Date();
  }
}

// Or via subscriber
class UserSubscriber implements EventSubscriber<User> {
  getSubscribedEntities() {
    return [User];
  }

  beforeCreate(args: EventArgs<User>) {
    args.entity.createdAt = new Date();
  }
}
```

See [Events and Hooks](https://mikro-orm.io/docs/events.md) for the complete event reference.
